## Cloudy Day and Starry Night -
### HTML5 canvas particle experiments based on Seb Lee Delisle Fronteers '11 presentation

[Seb Lee Delisle](sebleedelisle.com) gave an excellent presentation on creative coding at the [Fronteers 2011 conference](fronteers.nl/congres/2011/).
The source code for his particle experiments is on [github](https://github.com/sebleedelisle/JavaScript-PixelPounding-demos) and inspired me too turn my
homepage into a particle experiment based on the time of the day.

The result is a website that shows particle clouds if you visit it between 7 am and 6 pm
and a particle filled starry night between 6 pm and 7 am.

Just take a look at <code>js/main.js</code> to see what's going on.

Currently I'm trying to add support for IE through [Excanvas](http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/).
